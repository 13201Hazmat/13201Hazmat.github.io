                        <p>FIRST Robotics is a unique “varsity sport of the mind” where students are pushed
                             to further their knowledge of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and 
                             Mathematics). Our team works to design and build a robot to compete in FIRST events.
                             FIRST instills real-world professional experience and lifelong skills such as teamwork,
                             gracious professionalism, and coopertition (a combination of cooperation and competition 
                             between teams).There’s a job for everyone in this exceptionally fun learning environment! </p>

                        <p>MSOE students are bright, creative, hard-working and fun to be around. Theirs is a
                            close-knit community of about 3,000 students, faculty and staff—large enough for big
                             opportunities and small enough for personal attention. The faculty are passionate 
                             about teaching. MSOE does not use teaching assistants, and the professors have an 
                             average of seven years industry experience each. This allows them to bring their 
                             practical knowledge to the classroom. Small class sizes (an average of 21 students 
                             per class, 11 students per lab) keep instructors in close contact with students.</p>
